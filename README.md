### Description

Auto-Completes your Dropdown Combo Style ComboBoxes. Inspired by Dave Havard and Dan Redding's posts, I decided to write one of my own. It doesn't need the Keyboard Hook like Dave's and handles backspaces better than Dan's. Function is in a module and ready to be included in your project. Just call it on the Combo_Change event.<BR><BR>** Re-submitted 4/5/00 **<BR><BR>Minor Updates including ComboWidth updating (Thanks to Randy Birch's posts). I had to resubmit because khanjar@videotron.ca made an unwarrented vote of "poor". People were avoiding this post like the plague...for no good reason. Khanjar, you suck.<BR><BR>** Re-submitted 4/11/00 **<BR><BR>Includes a much better method for determining maximum text width. Thanks to Jeff Cockayne's contribution, additional features like Adding to History, Load & Save History plus allows use of upper & lower case typing. Thanks again Jeff! <BR><BR>Please Vote!<BR>
